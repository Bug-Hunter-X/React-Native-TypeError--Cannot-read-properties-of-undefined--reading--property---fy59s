This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common issue in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or component lifecycle methods.  For example, if you're trying to render data before it's loaded from an API, you'll encounter this error.  Another scenario is accessing a component's state before it's mounted.
